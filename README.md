# Divi-Builder multi language editor fix

The purpose of this project was to introduce a simple code change that fixes the issue with the Divi builder language used when editing a page.
Divi Builder currently does have any language other than English for use in the editor.
If you download the code fix in the repository you can very easily use any active language in WPML.
This works on any recent version (last year), and the changes are in just one file (2 places).
Note: Divi Support has had this code in their possession for well over 3 months but because of other changes they have deemed a higher priority
have not implemented this simple fix.
